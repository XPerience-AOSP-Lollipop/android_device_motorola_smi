Motorola SMI
===========================

XT890|Scorpion Mini Intel|Razr i

Motorola Razr i Intel-atom

Source from Turl, Oxavelar, Motorola, Intel and HazouPH

Bugs:
- Full screen video glitching (sometimes)
- High battery usage when using WIFI
- Disabling Airplane mode, doesn't reenable cell connection. U need to mannually reenable data connection
- Some apps don't install right (problem off the App maker, not ours)
- Cam quality

ToDo (what I can do):
- Add bluetooth 4.0 features
- Try to fix the 'App' problem
- Build with integrated kernel support when kernel is released
- FMRadio when kernel support
- Fix some media profiles including cam quality
- Maybe more if Moto releases sources
- Fix wifi battery drain when kernel support
- Optimize libs for intel-atom with ICC compiler if released, ~25% increase in rom performance.
